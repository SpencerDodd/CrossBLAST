# CrossBLAST
##### Author: Spencer Dodd
##### Affiliation: Northeastern University

This is a rough script that I have been using to do genomic research with automated BLAST queries. If you've stumbled on this page, the code isn't too pretty...I'm a biologist first, programmer second. I'm working on cleaning, fixing, and reorganizing it, but that's taking a backseat to data generation at the moment.

# OVERVIEW AND FOLLOWING INFO IS OUTDATED
## Will update soon.

## Overview

I nixed the whole README because it was so out of date, but the command to run everything is :

--------------------------------------------------------
```
python cross_blast.py ACCESSION_NUMBER
```

Where ACCESSION_NUMBER is an NCBI reference to a mitochondrial genome. I.e.

NC_084621
